"We live in a day and age where ..."

This phrase is always got on my nerves. I'm not sure why, perhaps because of how dramatic or gradiose the grouping of words aims to be.

But, sometimes it really does fit I suppose. I've recently been mulling over the current state of life as we (humanity) know it and a relization that's always been just behind the veil.


### We live in a day and age where the only limitations to an individual's knowledge is their own desire to know a piece of information or their drive and ability to comprend that information.

Once upon a time, the world was a place where only a select layer of society was given the privilege to access the wealth of collective human knowledge. However, through the unexpected effects of human ingenuity have we slowly removed the barrier. 

Inventions that change the dissemination of information have had the greatest impact. As they gained efficiency, their power was even greater. The quill, printing press, radio, television; they all revolutionized they way we consumed information. 

We can learn much from history, but these methods have one singular difference that sets them apart from computers &amp; internet. They were inheirently a single to many relationship in creation, the internet has created a many to many reality. The playing ground is level now, all voice has the same potential reach - at least idealistically. 

### Unfettered access

It goes unnoticed often, but you have the entirety of humanity's knowledge just sitting there in palm of your hand. It's a great time to be alive, don't waste it.
