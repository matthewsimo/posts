## Posts

I'm an insufferable layabout and I want to write, but I'll do anything to stop myself. So I'm aiming for the easiest way I know how, the path-of-least-resistance. Here are my posts. It's not a blog, but it might be one day...

### Structure

- Posts: littered throughout root following `YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md` format
- Drafts: live in `_drafts/` directory, no format enforced
- Images: live in `img/` directory, no format enforced
