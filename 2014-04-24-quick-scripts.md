Yesterday, my friend & collegue [Anthony](http://garand.me/ title="@garand") asked this question into the vast ether of twitter:

<!-- https://twitter.com/garand/status/459011728856977408 -->
> Anyone know of a tool that I can use to convert a bunch of files named like this: January 22, 2014.md to 2014-0122.md?

Luckily, I'd tinkered around with doing _sorta_ [similar tasks](https://github.com/matthewsimo/sniff) before. So, I followed up in our team chat with him to find out more details.

After I got enough info, I took a bit of time to wrap what I had been working on (can't lose any work!). While I was doing that, it gave my brain a chance to formulate the steps required in handling the file name conversion. Once I was ready, I took a couple of choice nuggets out of my sniff script and set to throwing something quick and easy together..

Ten minutes & a few tests later I pushed my script to [github](https://github.com/matthewsimo/file-name-conversion), and [told him](https://twitter.com/matthewsimo/status/459034623662518272) it was ready for cloning. 

Sure it was a simple problem that a single person encountered but it was exciting! A quick script that provided a real tangible result for a user, I'll call that a win.

It's an illustration of why I love programming, and why I love JavaScript. Programming is just a vehicle for solving problems. It acts as a conduit for making people's lifes easier, better, less painful and more rich...

And Javascript is _everywhere_. Literally! It's in your browser, phones, tablets, computers, servers.. it's on some robots for crying out loud. It is so pervasive, and it's so _fast_. When it comes to getting up & running, it's blazing fast. 

This is old news, but it's fun when I'm reminded. If you don't know the first thing about JavaScript, that's ok, lot's of people don't. Even people that use it all the time! I love to help, ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/matthewsimo) or send me an email (matthew(dot)a(dot)simo(at)gmail(dot)com) maybe I can get you on the right track. :)
