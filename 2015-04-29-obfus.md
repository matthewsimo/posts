I built a little app as an excuse to get to play with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Electron is built by GitHub and allows you to build cross platform desktop apps with web technologies, it's pretty neat. You may know it as Atom Shell, it was recently renamed, and powers apps like Atom Editor &amp; Slack.

Just to get a feel for using Electron, I wanted something simple, quick, and easy.

So, I built Obfus, it's a simple app that accepts text input and converts it to unicode characters.

You can use it to help protect your email in a `mailto` anchor tag, bots have a hard time finding emails when looking through pure unicode. It won't change your life but maybe you'll find it somewhat useful.
