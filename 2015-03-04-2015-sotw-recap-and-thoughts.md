I had the priviledge of being a part of panel discussing the [State of the Web](http://randyjensen.com/sotw/) organized by my friend [Randy Jensen](http://randyjensen.com/). It was a great discussion on the how/what/why that goes into crafting the Internet. We had some great questions and my co-panelists dropped some great knowledge bombs on these fledgling web designer &amp; developers.

There was a question asked that I in all honesty didn't know how to answer, "Who would you say has been the most influential in your development with working with the web?"

I just sat there and shut up because I was overwhelmed at the sheer number of people that have no idea how much they helped me in my forging of my career. It was truly humbling to reflect on how amazing the web worker community is.

I'm going to use this page to keep a running list as a sort of "shout out" place to honor these folks..
