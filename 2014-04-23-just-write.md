I'm fed up, sick and tired of my half-baked ideas. "I should start a blog", I'll say. Or, "I should write about x, y or z"... 

Then, after thinking, designing, even building pieces of functionality nothing materializes... Nothing ever gets _written_. I'll get bogged down in designing a car when all I needed was to walk down the street.

Well, enough is enough. I'm done with spinning my wheels and wasting my already limited time on the idea of writing. I'm going to _just write_.

Perhaps someday I'll build the perfect (for me) publishing system that still lays half-imagined in my head. But, even if I don't, I'll have this post. And if I have one, I can make another. 

It can't get much easier.. it's a directory of files on my file system, a repository of commits on github. It's not much, but it's a _step_. I'm going to _just write_, and see where I end up.
