Today I turned 30, it doesn't feel like I've lived that long though... here is a list of things I've learned so far.


- Always add a peppermint to green tea, it's delicious.
- Always add a dash of cinnamon to your coffee grounds before brewing.
- Buy good shoes, a good chair and a good bed. If you're not on your feet, you're sitting down or you're asleep.
- It's often _not_ just what you do your say, but _how_ you do or say it.
- People matter, even if they annoy you.
- Always be aware of your surroundings, opportunity to do _good_ is everywhere.
- Regardless of what you interact with, people, places or things, do your best to leave them better than you found them.
- Reading is better than watching TV.
- Family is important.
- Do your best at _everything_, it's better than coming up with an excuse of why you chose to half-ass it.
- Quiet is a friend and not an enemy.
- Good people, good food and good music make life, cultivate these things.
- It's better to have a handful of close friends than a legion of acquaintances. 
- Drink lot's of water.
- There is so much out there, accept you don't and can't know everything.
- Never stop learning.
- Apologizing is easy, forgiving is harder. Do both often.
- Rough roads can be avoided if you pay attention to where you are and where you're going.
- Don't sit on your ass all day, it's not worth it.
- It's easier to clean a little at a time every day than to clean all day once every 2 weeks.
- You can do a lot with eggs.
- Fresh basil over dried every time.
- Crushed black pepper might be the best spice.
- Salt & vinegar chips are the best, without question.
- A kind word and a smile can go a long way.
- Don't get caught up in what others might think or might say. It's a waste of time.
- Respect and appreciate what people people do and say.
- You never know what someone is thinking, even if you think their actions and speech give you a good idea.
- Say thank you and please. There is _never_ a reason to not give someone your respect.
- Realize your experiences could be largely misinformed.


Big thanks to:
- My wife for keeping me on my toes and my heart soft. 
- My parents for providing and raising me, your love shaped me into the man I am.
- My friends for making life fun.

That's all I got, thanks for reading. To another 30 years!
