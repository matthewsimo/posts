I came to Dallas in the fall 2002 to attend UT Dallas. I had no intention of staying for over a decade but I sure did. 

This city is great, I became an adult here, started a career here, forged friendships that I hope last a lifetime here. I met my wife here, we did however get married in Houston because that's where we both grew up. More on Houston later...

Dallas will always be a special place for me, I still think it's a largely underrated city. Tons of great restaurants, good bars, local breweries, cool parks. The traffic doesn't suck nearly as bad as some other places. Places such as Houston... 

My wife Vy is a smart lady, she recently applied and was accepted to the TWU Occupational Therapy program in Houston. She starts this fall, and as a result we're picking up and moving back down to Houson.

### The good stuff:

- Vy got into a very competitive program that has great career options upon graduation.
- We both have family there, my older brother's family, Vy's parents and her brother live there.
- At Lift UX, we're a remote workplace, so my job is unaffected by such a relocation.
- A new city to explore. We were children last we were in Houston, we are looking forward to experiencing the city as adults.
- We're planning on renting a house, so we'll have more room than the apartment we've been in.

### The not-so good stuff:

- Traffic sucks in Houston, everytime I visit I rant about how crappy of a job the city planners have done. Like seriously, it's balls.
- We love our family but we've been on our own for over a decade now. We really enjoy our independance, and are afraid of losing that. 
- Leaving our close Dallas friends, this is a big one. It makes us sad.

Anyways, that's where we're at. Big changes coming, but exciting stuff. We've told some people, but I wanted to write this to serve as a notice to anyone we might have missed. 

We definitely want to be able to say goodbye to all our friends, be sure and reach out if we havne't already made plans!
